    Removed code that was never executed in ``MPS::sample_measure``, also removed
    the ``shots`` parameter as it wasn't used.

    Probably the compiler can optimize out those things, but the code is cleaner
    this way. The ``params`` parameter was removed from ``MPS::sample_measure``
    as it's not used, also a check and unreacheable code from the same function
    is removed.

    There is no change in behaviour, just code cleanup.
    Refer to `#2305 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/2305>`
    for more details.
